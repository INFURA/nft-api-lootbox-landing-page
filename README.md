# The Infura NFT API Coding challenge

Welcome to the Infura NFT API coding challenge.  Follow the steps below to build and run this project locally.  After running the application, view the landing page in your browser at localhost:8080, choose one of the base starter applications and extend the functionality using a creative use-case leveraging the Infura NFT API.  

Then document your developer journey, and capture that journey in an article or video and
submit your content at https://lootbox.consensys.net following the link in the email you received for various Infura goodies and prizes.
